# Stripe Webhook Setup - Immediate Action Required

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL STEPS TO COMPLETE NOW

### âœ… What's Already Done:
- âœ… Webhook endpoint implemented at `/api/stripe-webhook`
- âœ… Environment file structure set up
- âœ… Stripe price IDs configured
- âœ… Webhook verification script created

### ðŸ”¥ URGENT: Complete These Steps

#### 1. Get Real Stripe Webhook Secret
```bash
# Current (placeholder):
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_your_actual_secret_here"

# Needs to be (from Stripe Dashboard):
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_your_actual_secret_here"
```

**How to get it:**
1. Go to [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
2. Create webhook endpoint: `https://your-domain.com/api/stripe-webhook`
3. Select events: `checkout.session.completed`, `customer.subscription.updated`, etc.
4. Copy the webhook secret (starts with `whsec_`)
5. Update your `.env.local` file

#### 2. Verify Stripe Keys
Ensure these are your real keys (not placeholders):
```bash
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_..." # Your real publishable key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."      # Your real secret key
```

#### 3. Test Your Setup
```powershell
# Test webhook locally
node scripts/verify-stripe-webhook.js

# Start your app
npm run dev

# Test payment flow
# Navigate to /dashboard and try subscribing to a plan
```
